A simple example of displaying Admob ads in an AndEngine application

Replace "YOUR ADMOB PUBLISHER ID" in AndroidManifest.xml and "YOUR AD UNIT ID HERE" in main.xml with your Admob ID.

Library dependencies on andengine.jar and GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-X.X.X.jar are also needed to compile this sample.

Much of the code from ScreenAdvertisement.java came from the AndEngine forum post http://www.andengine.org/forums/post6754.html
